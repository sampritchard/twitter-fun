### Twitter Bot
A bot that creates an Twitter update based on selecting a string from an array.

Currently, this is setup locally, so posts are not automated every 24 hours (which will be the end goal).

### To Do
- unit tests
- follow people based on word criteria
- like statuses based on word criteria
- set up on a 24 hour server for automatic posts update
